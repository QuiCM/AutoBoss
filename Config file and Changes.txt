ChangeLog:
v1.1.3- Changed default layout to stop crash OnUpdate.
V1.1.4- Changed OnUpdate section so layout shouldn't matter.
v1.1.5- Updated to ApiVersion(1, 14); Now works on Terraria 1.2
v1.2- Should now be able to support infinite arenas.

  - Added some code comments in the _Timer. Will potentially populate the rest with comments if I get bored
